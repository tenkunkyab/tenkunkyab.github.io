<p class="message">
  I live to code, travel, and experience everything I can get hold of.

I mostly work @cubitoin a company that's revolutionizing the way employees are transported. I work on the Backend Logic, which is where all the real fun begins. I like to learn new things, been trying my hands of rubiks cube now a days.
Hoping to become a real good person one day.
