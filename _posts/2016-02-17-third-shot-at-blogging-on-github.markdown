So yeah!
TinyPress didn't tick the right places.
At this time all I could find was that I need to Log In to TinyPress and then
write Posts. This is a Big No for me, as I have already mentioned earlier, I 
already have a BlogSpot.in account where I can do the same, and it is better 
integrated to share.

So I went away from the Pretty Poole, to TinyPress and now I'm back to stock 
Jekyll. The site doesn't look pretty but at least I can post in peace.

Till next time.
