title: Second Shot at Blogging on GitHub
layout: post
---
I gave my first shot at Blogging on GitHub.io with Jekyll.
Few things:
1. It was slow on my laptop to build
2. Installation of Jekyll took forever
3. I do not speak Ruby
4. I was actually spending more time on how to fix it, rather
    than blogging

My Second shot at Blogging on GitHub.io is via TinyPress.
I do not know how this will pan out.
Optimally I would prefer "not" using the "tinypress.co" url to blog,
( I was already doing that with http://tenkunkyab.blogspot.in/ )

If there are more blog posts without any title resembling "Third/Fourth"
then TinyPress it doing it for me.
