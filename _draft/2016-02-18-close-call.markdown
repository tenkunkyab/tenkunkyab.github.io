On my way back from office.
I must be cruising on empty road, 60-80 kmph. Nice and dark.
So I was paying extra attention on what is around me. From 
a Hundred meter or so I saw this Yellow Dog crossing the road.
Thinking that the dog will cross the road till I reach the 
spot, I did not slow down. I was getting closer, perhaps 
around 30 meter or so and that's when I realize that the dog
wasn't alone. Skipping along was a puppy, black ( didn't help
at the time as it was around 10 o'clock ) brown eye-brows.
I just tapped on the brakes, just enough to slow down & let
the puppy cross the road at the same time. Blood rushed to 
my face, heart all pumped up, and my breathes heavy.

The puppy safely crossed the road with it's mamma. I slowed 
down considerably, around 30 kmph now. And all I could see
was this dark puppy with yellow eye-brows. And then my thoughts
filled with What-Ifs.

Thought about blind faith.
